# Express.js Route Handler Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: not gracefully handling cases where data is not found. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The original code attempts to send a response directly from the route handler without proper error handling. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes. 

## Solution

The solution introduces more robust error handling by checking for the existence of `user` data before sending the response. If the user is not found, a 404 status code is returned with an appropriate message. This improves the application's resilience and provides better feedback to the client.
